# Pet Shop Dublin

Pet Shop Dublin website, where you can select one of our services from the service list and also register your pet's details like:
name, if they are either a cat or a dog, the owner's name and the owner's phone.

Create an API service (you must use Node.js and MongoDB) that supports fullCRUD for your existing CA1 app

Update your existing CA1 app to allow populating the HTML table with JSON data provided by the API, implement the ability to Add and Delete items from that table using your new API only from your front-end. You are free to use any available frontend
frameworks/plugins to implement that functionality (Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, etc.)

Deploy your application to Heroku and your database to MongoDB Atlas. Possess a coherent commit history on GitHub (at least 8 valid and logical commits) and have your final submission code present in your Git repository
